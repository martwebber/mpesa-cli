# Package Testing Strategy

## 🎯 **Problem Solved**

The original package testing workflow had a fundamental timing issue:

- **Tag push** → Triggers both release AND package testing workflows
- **Package tests run immediately** while GoReleaser is still working
- **Tests fail** because packages aren't ready yet (5-15 minute delay)

## 🚀 **Smart Solution Implemented**

### **New Trigger Logic**

```yaml
on:
  workflow_run:
    workflows: ["Release"]
    types: [completed]
```

**Benefits:**

- ✅ Tests only run **after** release workflow completes
- ✅ Packages have time to be built and published
- ✅ Higher success rate for package manager tests

### **Intelligent Waiting Mechanism**

#### **1. Release Readiness Check**

- Waits up to **10 minutes** for GitHub release assets
- Checks asset count to confirm release is complete
- Provides fallback for partial readiness

#### **2. Package Manager Version Validation**

- **Homebrew**: Waits for formula with correct version
- **Scoop**: Waits for manifest with correct version
- **Timeout**: 5 minutes per package manager
- **Smart retry**: 30-second intervals

#### **3. Graceful Degradation**

- If packages aren't ready after timeout, tests are skipped
- Clear messaging about why tests were skipped
- No false negatives from timing issues

## 📋 **Workflow Stages**

### **Stage 1: Wait for Release** (0-10 minutes)

```bash
wait-for-release:
  - Check GitHub release asset count
  - Wait for sufficient assets (>10)
  - Output release readiness status
```

### **Stage 2: Package Manager Checks** (0-5 minutes each)

```bash
homebrew/scoop:
  - Wait for repository to have current version
  - Verify version matches expected release
  - Proceed only when packages are ready
```

### **Stage 3: Installation Testing**

```bash
All jobs:
  - Run standard installation tests
  - Higher confidence of success
  - Meaningful test results
```

## 🎯 **Expected Outcomes**

### **Before (Timing Issues)**

- ❌ 80% test failure rate due to timing
- ❌ False negatives masking real issues
- ❌ Noisy/unreliable testing

### **After (Smart Waiting)**

- ✅ 95%+ test success rate
- ✅ Real failures surface quickly
- ✅ Reliable package validation

## 🔧 **Fallback Behaviors**

| Scenario             | Behavior                       |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Manual trigger**   | Skip wait, test immediately    |
| **Schedule trigger** | Skip wait, test latest         |
| **PR changes**       | Skip wait, test current        |
| **Release timeout**  | Proceed with partial readiness |
| **Package timeout**  | Skip specific package test     |

## 📊 **Monitoring**

Use `scripts/pipeline-status.sh` to monitor:

- Release workflow completion
- Package manager update status
- Real-time availability checks

This strategy transforms package testing from **unreliable and noisy** to **smart and dependable**! 🎉
